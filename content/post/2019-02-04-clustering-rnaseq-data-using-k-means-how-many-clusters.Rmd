From the archive:  Clustering gene expression data allows us to identify substructures in the data and identify groups of genes that behave similarly. This method can help us identify genes that share a biological function (co-functional) and genes that are under the same control logic (co-regulated). Here we'll show how to cluster RNAseq data using K-means clustering. We'll address picking the appropriate clustering number then we'll test drive some visualizations and plots.
